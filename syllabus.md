## Late work.

Generally it is a good idea to get the homework done one time.
 

                         

## Title IX â€“ Duty to Report
 
The University of Wyoming faculty are committed to helping create a safe learning environment for all students and for
the university as a whole. If you have experienced any form of gender or sex-based discrimination or harassment,
including sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, or stalking, know that help and support are
available. The University has staff members trained to support survivors in navigating campus life, accessing health and
counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, and more. The University strongly encourages all
students to report any such incidents to the University. Please be aware that all University of Wyoming employees,
including student staff, are required to report all Title IX related concerns to the Title IX Coordinator or their
supervisor. This means that if you tell a faculty member about a situation of sexual harassment or sexual violence, or
other related misconduct, the faculty member must share that information with the Universityâ€™s Title IX Coordinator.
UWâ€™s Title IX Coordinator is Jim Osborn (Manager of Investigations, Equal Opportunity Report and Response). He is
located in Room 320 of the Bureau of Mines Building, and can be reached via email at report-it@uwyo.edu or via phone at
766-5200 or 766-5228. For more information, go to:
[http://www.uwyo.edu/reportit/learn-more/faqs.html](http://www.uwyo.edu/reportit/learn-more/faqs.html) .

## Attendance and Absence policies

Attendance is critical.  The only way to know what you need to know is by
attending class. If you have an excused absence that is fine, try to get notes from the day you missed from one of your
classmates. Just don't skip!

## Classroom Behavior Policy

At all times, treat your presence in the classroom and your enrollment in this course as you would a job. Act
professionally, arrive on time, pay attention, complete your work in a timely and professional manner. You will be
respectful towards your classmates and instructor. Spirited debate and disagreement are to be expected in any classroom
and all views will be heard fully, but at all times we will behave civilly and with respect towards one another.
Personal attacks, offensive language, name-calling, and dismissive gestures are not warranted in a learning atmosphere.
As the instructor, I have the right to dismiss you from the classroom.

## Classroom Statement on Diversity

The University of Wyoming values an educational environment that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive. The diversity
that students and faculty bring to class, including age, country of origin, culture, disability, economic class,
ethnicity, gender identity, immigration status, linguistic, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation,
veteran status, worldview, and other social and cultural diversity is valued, respected, and considered a resource for
learning. 

## Disability Support

If you have a physical, learning, sensory or psychological disability and require accommodations, please register as
soon as possible and provideÂ documentation of your disability to Disability Support Services (DSS), Room 109 Knight
Hall. You may also contact DSS at (307) 766-3073 orÂ udss@uwyo.edu.Â Visit their website for more
information:Â www.uwyo.edu/udss

## Academic Dishonesty Policies

Don't cheat on the exams. I expect you to take full advantage of all the online resources you can get your hands on.
That includes Stack Overflow, Github etc. If you do use someone else's code, put in a link to where you found it.
Don't cheat on the projects - do you own work.  Most of the learning in the class is from *doing* the projects.

## Substantive changes to syllabus

All deadlines, requirements, and course structure are subject to change if deemed necessary by the instructor. Students
will be notified verbally in class, on our WyoCourses page announcement, and via email of these changes. I do travel
during the semester. Class could be canceled or assignments due dates changed.
